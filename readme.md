# HackTalk v2.0!

A ton of hard work was put into this new version of HackTalk. [@19wintersp](https://repl.it/@19wintersp) and [@xxperthacker](https://repl.it/@xxperthacker) made my code much better and they added a ton of new stuff (of course, I did help with some things...)

~~No~~ **WAY less** bugs! New CSS and layout! Added requested features!

Changes include:

* Added Markdown! *(finally!)*
* Notifications
* Question previews
* Favicon
* Anti-XSS features
* New layout
* Reduced clutter
* Moderator features actually working

If you have anything else to suggest, or bugs to report, [please share them with us](https://hacktalk.epicgamer007.repl.co/question-0).
